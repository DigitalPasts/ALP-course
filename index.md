## Short Description

The proposed course on Ancient Language Processing aims to focus specifically on ancient languages and scripts from the emergence of writing in Mesopotamia and Egypt, to the entire world up till 800 AD. There are millions of pieces of writings in these ancient languages, which require expert knowledge of these languages, explicit efforts to build lexicon and corpora, as well as new-designed Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. This course will introduce students of ancient history, ancient Near Eastern languages, and computer science to this subfield of NLP. They will engage inscribed artefacts from machine-based observation (e.g. Computer Vision and OCR) and dataset pre-processing, to their final digital publication.

## Course Objectives

Ancient languages contain rich human historical and cultural wealth. So far there has been good advancement in applying language technologies to ancient languages such as Sumerian, Akkadian, Latin, Ancient Greek, and Ancient Chinese, especially in the construction of digital language resources and resources to facilitate automatic analysis. For example, the Universal Dependencies (UD) project has made treebanks available for a series of ancient languages. The objective of this course is to computationally engage with ancient datasets of inscribed artefacts, mostly texts, from observation to publication. We will analyze classical studies and consider emerging research questions in the field of ancient Near Eastern studies, in order to address them computationally using ancient language processing.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will discuss and contrast the shared epigraphical challenges in ancient language processing: such as Latin, non-Latin and non-alphabetic scripts, Right-to-Left, transliteration conventions and fragmentary texts, and in particular, the multilingual framework to represent the morphology, syntax, and semantics, as well as machine translation models. They will perform hands-on digital philology with novel methods, code, and techniques. The main outcome of the course will be a collaborative computational research paper on an ancient dataset.
